After running the above command, if you receive a version number, you don't need to install it again.

Subsequently, if you get the following error message, you need to install the win32com library on your system:

Installing win32com Library
Open the prompt and type in the pip command to install the library from the terminal window.

"""
Where:

ol: New variable to store the connection reference.
win32com.client: Windows library to establish a connection between Python and Outlook.
Dispatch: Function to create the connection.
Outlook.Application: This can be replaced with any Microsoft application name, as required.

"""
Next, it is necessary to define the dimensions of the new email message so that Python understands where the
content needs to be updated.
"""

# size of the new email
olmailitem = 0x0

"""
Where:

olmailitem: New variable to store the dimensions.
0x0: Dimensions of the new email message in Python’s memory.
Python’s functions pop-open a new email item, as soon as you define the email body dimensions.
"""

newmail = ol.CreateItem(olmailitem)

"""
Where:

. newmail: New variable to store the new email reference.
. ol: Reference of the previously created connection between Python and Outlook.
. CreateItem(olmailitem): Command to create a new email draft.

Since every email is incomplete without a subject line, you can define it within the code so that Python
adds it automatically before sending the email to the recipient. This will be visible to the recipient, so
be careful how you define the case and the content.
"""

newmail.Subject = 'Testing Mail'

"""
Where:

newmail: Variable to store the new mail item reference.
Subject: This can vary, depending on what you wish to have as the subject for your email.
You can add the intended recipients within the To and CC keywords as follows:
"""

newmail.To = 'sina.kian@mail.polimi.it'
newmail.CC = 'skr_e@yahoo.com'

"""
Where:

To: Main recipient’s email address.
CC: Copied email recipients.
With Python, you can send emails to multiple recipients. Add a semi-colon (;) separator between email IDs
within the To/CC column.

Finally, once you define the subject and the recipients, you can add the email body to the new mail item
before sending it to the recipients within the To and CC columns.
"""

newmail.Body= 'Hello, this is a test email to showcase how to send emails from Python and Outlook.'
mail.HTMLBody = html_pages + <br><img src="http://www.intrumlaw.it/">

"""
To add attachments to your email, you can use the following commands:
"""

attach = r'C:\Users\s.kian\OneDrive - Intrum Law\Desktop\Patr\Decreti perenti Penelope check attività legale update 23.01.23.xlsx'
newmail.Attachments.Add(attach)

"""
As the email is ready to be sent, there are two options you can use. If you want a preview of your email
before sending it to the recipients, you can use the Display() command as follows:
"""

newmail.Display()


"""
You can use the Send() command if you want to send the email without reviewing it beforehand.
"""

newmail.Send()
